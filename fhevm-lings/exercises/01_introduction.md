# Welcome to FHElings! 🎓

**FHElings** is an interactive learning tool inspired by Rustlings, designed to teach you **FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine)** through hands-on practice.

## What is FHEVM?

FHEVM is a revolutionary technology developed by **Zama** that allows you to perform computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This enables:

-  **Private smart contracts** - Keep data encrypted on-chain
-  **Confidential gaming** - Hidden information (fog of war) on blockchain
-  **Secret voting** - Truly private on-chain governance
-  **Sealed auctions** - Bid without revealing your amount
-  **Privacy-preserving analytics** - Compute on sensitive data

## How FHElings Works

1. **Read the exercise** - Each exercise has a TODO comment
2. **Write the solution** - Fill in the missing code
3. **Save the file** - The system automatically tests your solution
4. **Get feedback** - Instant hints if something is wrong
5. **Advance** - Press 'n' to go to the next exercise

## Your Learning Path

You'll learn to:
- ✅ Import and use the FHE library
- ✅ Encrypt values (uint32 → euint32)
- ✅ Perform arithmetic on encrypted data (add, subtract, multiply)
- ✅ Compare encrypted values without revealing them
- ✅ Implement conditional logic with encrypted data
- ✅ Use encrypted booleans (ebool)
- ✅ Manage encrypted state in smart contracts
- ✅ Decrypt values safely

## Tips for Success

 **Use hints progressively** - Press 'h' for gentle guidance, press again for more specific help

 **Track your progress** - Press 's' to see your statistics and streak

 **Go at your own pace** - Press 'n' to advance, 'l' to choose any exercise

 **Read error messages** - They often point directly to the problem

## Ready to Start?

**Delete this file to begin your journey!**

Once you delete `exercises/01_introduction.md`, the system will automatically move to the first coding exercise.
